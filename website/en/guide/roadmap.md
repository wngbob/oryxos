# Roadmap

Our development philosophy: **slow is fast — restrained and focused**. Nail the single-node runtime kernel first, then grow distributed capabilities step by step.

## Project Status

**Current phase: design finalized, runtime kernel in development.**

- [x] Industry research / requirements / technical solution / AI programming guide
- [x] Spec-Kit development workflow
- [x] Maven 9-module project skeleton (compiles and packages; fat JAR and CLI entries both runnable)
- [ ] Core phase: five core capabilities (runtime kernel)
- [ ] Three acceptance demos: daily weather / daily tech digest / daily GitHub digest
- [ ] OryxOS 1.0 release

## Three Phases

### Phase 1 (Now) · Single-node Runtime Kernel

Five core capabilities working: configuration-as-Agent, multi-Agent coexistence, REST API access, MCP integration.

### Phase 2 (Planned) · Distributed Harness

Stateless nodes, external state, multi-replica deployment — supporting larger scale and high availability.

### Phase 3 (Vision) · Cross-node Agent Collaboration

Introduce an Agent communication fabric over A2A: cross-node discovery, delegation, and reliable asynchronous coordination.

### Cross-cutting Capabilities

Built alongside each phase: multi-tenancy, SSO, complete audit, tool policies, observability, web console.

## Long-term Goal

**Join the Apache Software Foundation and become an Apache Top-Level Project.**

## Contributing

OryxOS is incubated by the oryx-labs community — an AI-coding-driven AI exploration community.

- Main development follows **Spec-Driven Development** (Spec-Kit): `specify → plan → tasks → implement`
- Incremental contributions (bug fixes, Plugin Tools, docs): edit the existing code and open a PR
- Before contributing, read the "Inviolable Principles" section of `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root — code that violates the red lines must be reworked
